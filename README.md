# AI Sentiment Analysis of Text Data Using Python

This project applies **artificial intelligence techniques**, specifically **machine learning and natural language processing (NLP)**, to analyze and classify the sentiment of Amazon customer reviews. Using Python-based tools, the system learns patterns from text data to determine whether reviews express positive or negative sentiment.
This project demonstrates a complete analysis workflow, from data preprocessing and feature extraction to sentiment classification and result interpretation using real-world text data.

The project was built for learning and experimentation, with a focus on understanding how sentiment analysis works under the hood rather than treating it as a black box.

## 📦 Technologies

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
